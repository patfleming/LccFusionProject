# BOD Card Planning Guide {#bod_card_assembly-planning-guide}

Block Occupancy Detection (BOD) on a model train layout provide tactile control and interaction, enhancing the user experience and allowing for precise operation of various features.

Below is an assortment of ways the BOD Card can be utilized to operate for your model railroad layout:

| Block Detection Use                   | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Detect Train Presence                 | The card senses when a train enters a block, allowing the system to update signal aspects and turnout positions accordingly. |
| Occupancy-Based Signaling             | Triggers signals to display a 'stop' aspect when a train is detected, ensuring other trains do not enter the occupied block. |
| Route Setting Based on Occupancy      | Automatically adjusts turnouts to route trains correctly based on block occupancy to prevent collisions. |
| Support for Automated Train Operation | Facilitates automatic train control by providing real-time occupancy status to the system, which can be used to start, stop, and speed control trains without manual intervention. |
| Emergency Brake Trigger               | In case of a detected issue, such as unexpected occupancy, the system can trigger an emergency stop to prevent accidents. |
| Aid in Traffic Management             | Helps manage train traffic by allowing more sophisticated logic for track reservations and train scheduling based on block occupancy. |
| Prevent Dispatcher Errors             | Provides an additional layer of safety by confirming the status of track occupancy to prevent dispatcher errors in manual control systems. |
| Enhance Layout Realism                | Contributes to the realism of the layout by automating train movements and interactions just like in the real world. |
| Diagnostics and Maintenance           | Block detection cards can log occupancy data for diagnostics, helping to identify potential issues with train detection or track integrity. |
| Multi-train Coordination              | Allows multiple trains to be coordinated smoothly by providing essential data for synchronization and timing of train movements. |

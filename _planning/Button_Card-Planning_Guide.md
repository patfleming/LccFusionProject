# Button Card Planning Guide {#button_card-planning-guide}

Buttons on a model train layout provide tactile control and interaction, enhancing the user experience and allowing for precise operation of various features.

Below is an assortment of ways the Button Card can be utilized to operate for your model railroad layout:

| Button Use                 | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Start/Stop Trains          | Use buttons to manually start or stop trains on various tracks. |
| Change Train Directions    | Allow operators to change the direction of a train's travel. |
| Activate Sound Effects     | Trigger sound effects like train whistles, station announcements, or ambient noises. |
| Control Lighting Effects   | Turn on or off specific lighting elements, or change lighting scenarios (e.g., day to night). |
| Operate Turnouts           | Switch the rail turnouts to direct trains to different tracks. |
| Animate Scenery            | Activate moving parts in the scenery, such as opening bridge, rotating windmill, or animated figures. |
| Control Level Crossings    | Operate gates and signals at level crossings manually.       |

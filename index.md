## Roles and Responsibilities

The LCC Fusion Project is targetted at a broad spectrum of topics including hardware and firmware, that impacts layout automation planning, design, and implementation.  This typically requires skills from one or more people.  Below is a roles and repsonsibility summary and its relationship to this project and its documentation.

Use documentationâ€™s navigation area and the [Explore Subjects](/subjects/) page to find documentation based on your role.

Note that responsibilities listed below may well be implemented by a single person as they plan, design, and implement a own layout.  In other situations, the repsonsibilities my shared across model train club members, each working together.

  

| Role                | Responsibility                                               | [Subject Areas](/subjects/)                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Layout Architect    | Focuses on the high-level design and planning of model railroad layouts. The Layout Architect considers the operational logic, thematic consistency, and overall aesthetic. They are responsible for the blueprint of the layout, integrating various components and systems to achieve a cohesive design. | Quick Start Guides<br> Planning For LCC<br> Layout Architect |
| Layout Engineer     | Specializes in the technical and practical aspects of building and maintaining the layout. The Layout Engineer works on the implementation of the design, including track laying, wiring, and the integration of control systems. They ensure that the layout operates smoothly and reliably. | Quick Start Guides<br> Layout Deployment                     |
| System Integrator   | Acts as a bridge between hardware and firmware components of the LCC Fusion Project. The System Integrator ensures seamless communication between control systems, sensors, actuators, and user interfaces. They are key in troubleshooting issues and optimizing system performance. | Layout Deployment                                            |
| firmware Developer  | Develops and maintains the firmware that powers the LCC Fusion Project, including firmware for hardware devices and applications for control and monitoring. The firmware Developer is focused on creating user-friendly, efficient, and robust firmware solutions | Layout Deployment                                            |
| Hardware Specialist | Expert in the selection, assembly, and configuration of hardware components within the LCC Fusion system. The Hardware Specialist advises on the best practices for electronic component selection and helps troubleshoot hardware-related issues. | PCB Build<br> Builder Tips<br> Hardware<br> Cards<br> Breakout Boards |
| DIY Hobbyist        | Enthusiasts who are interested in building and customizing their model railroad layouts with a hands-on approach. DIY Hobbyists look for guidance on projects that they can undertake themselves, leveraging the flexibility of the LCC Fusion Project to personalize their layouts. | Planning for LCC                                             |
| Educator            | Uses the LCC Fusion Project as a teaching tool to introduce students to concepts of electronics, programming, and system design within the context of model railroading. Educators seek resources that can be used to facilitate learning in workshops, classes, or individual projects | Planning for LCC                                             |

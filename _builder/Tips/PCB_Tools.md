# PCB Tools {#pcb_tools}

## Introduction

The following is a list of tools used in PCB assembly.  Some are required, while others are optional as noted in the table below.

At a minimum, you need:

1. Personal Safety; safety glasses, surface protector, solder fumes extractor
2. Soldering pencil to soldering the component pins
3. Method of soldering the SMD components; soldering pencil, soldering stations /w soldering hot air gun, hot plate, or desktop oven
4. Solder; both wire and paste in a syringe **recommended** or container
5. Method of applying solder paste
   1. Spreading paste across a PCB Stencil  using palette knife, or scraper (**recommended**).  For PCB Cards, use push pins thru the tooling holes to hold the stencil in place.
   2. Using a syringe of paste to apply directly to solder pads on the PCB
6. Surface protection; Silicone Repair Mat, or some other non-burn surface
7. Method of placing components/parts; tweezers, or sticky pencil
8. Method of cleaning the PCB; alcohol and rag
9. Organizers for PCB components, each clearly and accurately label (match the PCB component’s description )
10. Method holding the PTH parts in place while solder pins from the PCB **bottom**; tacky putty

# Safety Precautions {#safety_precautions_assembly}

When building a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and soldering, it's important to follow basic safety precautions to prevent accidents and ensure a safe working environment. Here's a list of essential safety tips:

1. **Wear Protective Gear**:
   - Safety glasses to protect your eyes from solder splashes and fumes.
   - Gloves to protect your hands from hot components and solder.

2. **Proper Ventilation**:
   - Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes from the solder, especially if it contains flux or lead.
   - Consider using a fume extractor or a fan to direct fumes away from your face.

3. **Use the Right Tools**:
   - Use a soldering iron stand to prevent the hot iron from coming into contact with flammable materials.
   - Ensure your soldering iron has a heat-resistant handle.

4. **Handle Soldering Iron with Care**:
   - Always assume the soldering iron is hot. Hold it by the handle only.
   - Turn off the soldering iron when not in use.

5. **Be Cautious with Lead Solder**:
   - If using lead-based solder, wash your hands thoroughly after use to avoid accidental ingestion of lead.
   - Consider using lead-free solder as a safer alternative.

6. **Avoid Working with Live Circuits**:
   - Never solder or make adjustments to a circuit while it is powered.

7. **Keep Your Work Area Organized**:
   - Keep your workspace tidy to prevent accidents.
   - Store flammable materials away from the soldering area.

8. **Use Heat-Resistant Surfaces**:
   - Work on a heat-resistant surface to avoid accidental burns or fire.

9. **Be Careful with Component Handling**:
   - Be cautious with components that can store electrical charge even when the power is off, like capacitors.

10. **Stay Hydrated and Take Breaks**:
    - Soldering for long periods can be straining, so ensure you take regular breaks and stay hydrated.

11. **First Aid and Emergency Preparedness**:
    - Keep a first aid kit nearby and be familiar with basic first aid procedures for burns.
    - Know how to quickly disconnect power in case of an emergency.

Following these precautions will help minimize risks associated with PCB building and soldering activities.

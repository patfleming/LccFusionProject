## Buttons Types {#button_types}

The following button types are supported by the Button Card.  

> Even though the Button Card provides debouncing, a button detection may still be inconsistent.  This can be resolved, when configuring the button using a configuration tool and setting the **Debounce** field to a value > 0.

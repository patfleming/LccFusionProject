# Preparing a PCB For Soldering {#pcb_prep}

## Introduction

Before soldering, it's important to clean the PCB to ensure the removal of any contaminants like dust, grease, or oxidation. A clean surface ensures better solder adhesion and electrical connectivity, leading to higher quality and reliability of the solder joints. Simple cleaning can be performed using isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth or brush, wiping gently to avoid damaging any pre-mounted components or the PCB surface. This step is crucial for achieving optimal soldering results.

# PCB Design Guidelines {#pcb_design_guidelines}

This section outlines key guidelines and practices adopted in the PCB design:

1. **Signal Integrity**: Our PCB strictly handles digital signals, eliminating the possibility of interference between analog and digital signal paths.
2. **Power Delivery**: To maintain a stable power supply and mitigate noise, decoupling capacitors are strategically positioned adjacent to the IC power pins.
3. **Thermal Considerations**: Components on the PCB are selected to minimize heat generation, with current draw kept below 3A, hence substantial heat dissipation measures are not required.  Voltage regulators use integrated heat sinks.
4. **Component Placement**:
   - **Identification**: PCB silk screening includes components labels and component descriptions to simplify identification and installation.   Smaller labels are used during assembly, larger labels during configuration.  All labels are orientated the same direction for usability.  Component label number is sequenced starting in PCB upper left and proceeding downward.
   - **Orientation**: Components of a similar nature are grouped and aligned to simplify identification and installation.  PCB silk screening includes alignment details.
   - **Accessibility**: Components are of a size conducive to manual DIY assembly and optimized for reflow soldering, with SMD components favored for their compatibility with solder paste and stencil application. Tooling holes on stencils facilitate precise alignment on the PCB.
   - **Connectivity**: Connector locations are carefully planned near PCB edges for user convenience and provide multiple options to accommodate various wiring configurations to external devices.
5. **Mechanical Design**: The PCBs are crafted for straightforward assembly, featuring generous component sizing such as 1206 SMD resistors and capacitors for effortless soldering. Mounting provisions like holes support versatile installation via DIN adapters, screws, and casings.
6. **Connectivity and Interfaces**:
   - The LCC Fusion Project **Cards** connect seamlessly with card edge connectors on the **Node Bus Hub** for robust wireless communication, with standoffs available to fortify the card assemblies.  The card is shaped with an ‘orientation key’ for correct alignment in the hub. 
   - Network cables ensure reliable and swift 8-wire connections between **Cards** and **Breakout Boards**.
   - Breakout boards use sockets appropriate for the type of wiring expected.  Multiple wiring options are available for many of the breakout boards.  For example, ATX connectors for larger guage wires, JST XH for smaller wires using quick connect plugs.
   
7. **Manufacturability**:
   - The designs are developed and tested with the renowned PCB design tool, Fritzing.
   - PCBs are 2-layer, allowing for modification by all PCB design tools, including Fritzing.
   - Gerber files are furnished for hassle-free fabrication order placement with most PCB manufacturers, including JLCBPC for economical PCB production and stencil creation.
   - The choice of common, easily obtainable components facilitates cost-effective sourcing for DIY enthusiasts and professional assembly services alike.
   
8. **Reliability**:
   - Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection for communication data lines, such as CAN Bus and I2C interfaces, is ensured through the use of ESD Protection Diodes (PESD1CAN) on the data lines.
   - Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) protection for communication data lines, such as CAN Bus and I2C interface, is ensure through the use of Data Line Noise Suppression Ferrite Bead (BLM31PG121SN1L) to suppress the high-frequency noise in the electronic circuits.
   - PCBs are designed for effortless replacement, leveraging simple mounts and quick-connect terminals for fast turnover.
   - The LCC Fusion Node Card design incorporates female headers for the DevKit-C ESP32 Module, streamlining module swaps. Configuration backups and restorations for new modules are supported by JMRI tools.
   
9. **Testing and Diagnostics**:
   - The **Node Bus Hub** simplifies wiring and configuration during testing phases.
   - Input/output function checks are performed using button and LED-equipped cards and breakout boards.
   - LCC Events generated via JMRI tools are employed to actuate PCB I/O for test purposes.
   - Serial monitor capabilities facilitate connectivity assessments and provide a suite of tools for I/O testing endeavors.

This approach to PCB design ensures a user-friendly assembly process, robust performance, and ease of maintenance, aligning with the standards of the **LCC Fusion Project**.

## Introduction

The **Signal Masts Breakout Board** , used in tandem with the PWM Card, is designed to manage the operation of signaling mast lamps. In a standard LCC Fusion Node Cluster, this board connects to the signal mast lamps (typically LEDs), interfacing with a  PWM Card to adjust signal aspects in response to LCC Events. These events are often generated by configured Logics and Conditions, which monitor variables such as track block occupancy, the status of other signal masts, and the positions of turnout points.

## Specifications

Specifications for the BOD Card include:

| Characteristic                                    | Value  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Max Lamps                                         | 15     |
| Max 3-Lamp Heads                                  | 5      |
| Max 2-Lamp Heads                                  | 8      |
| Max Total Current<sup>1</sup>                     | 1000mA |
| Maximum Signal Masts Breakout Boards per PWM Card | 1      |

1. Max current with CAT6 23awg wiring.  Signal Masts Breakout Board uses 48mil traces that support up to 3+A, allowing for more current across all output lines.

### How It Works

The Signal Masts Breakout Board simply provides direct connections from the network cable inputs to the sockets that connect to signal lamps.  There are two selector that can be set as follows:

| Selector Label  | Components Indicator |      Options       | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | :------------: | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LINE 16`       |      JP1       | `OUTPUT`, `COMMON` | Configures line 16 for either: <br> - `OUTPUT` mode, where it behaves like the other 15 output lines.<br>- `COMMON` mode, serving as a collective ground or power supply for the other lines. <br>For instance, if controlling 15 LEDs with lines 1-15, line 16 can act as a common ground or power source, depending on the `OUTPUT COMMON` setting. |
| `OUTPUT COMMON` |      JP2       |    `GND`, `V+`     | Decides if line 16 operates as a ground (GND) or a power supply (V+).<br>Note: `LINE 16` selector must be on `COMMON` for this setting to apply. |

For Signaling details, refer to the [PWM Card How it Works](/pwm-card-assembly-guide/) section. 

### Connectors

The purpose of the **Signal Masts Breakout Board** and its connectors is to facilitate quick and easy connections between the LCC Fusion cards. For setups with requiring expansion, the Node Bus Hub provides connections to additional hubs.

| **JP2**                | COMMON               | 3P Male Header                | 1 - 3                 | Use Jumper Cap with `COMMON` selector to select either the lamps common connection is `V+` or `GND`, depending on lamps shared connection (V+ for anode, GND for cathode). |

1. Use of JST XH pre-wired plugs soldered to track rail drop wires makes for easy wiring and fast connect/disconnect.
2. Use of 2-position Terminals (2.54mm) allow for rail drop wires to be connected directly pulling back a spring lever.  These connectors can be ordered as 2-Position or assembled into a set of 2-Positions.

## Testing and Verification

### Visual Inspection

1. **Initial Check**: Examine the board for any obvious issues like missing components, solder bridges, or components that are misaligned or not fully seated.

2. **Solder Joint Inspection**: Use a magnifying glass or a microscope to inspect solder joints. Look for cold solder joints, insufficient or excessive solder, or any shorts between pads.

3. Use an **Digital Multimeter (DMM)** to test for continuity between the input connection pins and the output connection pins as follows:

   | Socket (Pin#) | JST (Pin #)       | Socket (Pin#) | JST (Pin #)        |
   | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
   | J15 (1)       | J1 (1) and J6 (1) | J16 (1)       | J3 (3) and J10 (1) |

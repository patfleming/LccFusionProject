## Introduction

The **Stepper Motor Breakout Board**, in combination with the LCC LCC Fusion Node Card and I/O Card, is a versatile and powerful solution designed to control up to two 28BYJ-48 12V stepper motors in model railroad automation and other low-power, precision motor control applications. 

This breakout board interfaces with the I/O Card via a standard network cable, using the MCP23017 GPIO expander to send control signals. Each motor is driven by the M54562FP Darlington array, allowing for reliable and efficient operation of the stepper motors through a simple JST XH 5-wire connector. Powered by the layout accessory bus through an LM7812 voltage regulator, the Stepper Motor Breakout Board provides a stable 12V supply to the motors and control circuitry, ensuring smooth operation. Designed for integration into LCC Fusion systems, this board allows for precise motor control, supporting a wide range of automation tasks.

Specifications for the Stepper Motor Breakout Board include:

| Characteristic                                               | Value |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Max Motors                                                   | 2     |
| Output                                                       | 12V   |

1. Max current per motor is based on the LM7812 voltage regulator and fuse.

### How It Works

**1. ESP32 Control via MCP23017 and AccelStepper Library:**

- The **ESP32** is responsible for controlling the stepper motors through the **MCP23017** GPIO expander using the **MCP23017AccelStepper.h** library.
- The **MCP23017** I/O expander communicates over the **I2C bus** and handles the GPIO pins needed to control the stepper motors, which allows the ESP32 to control multiple I/O devices with fewer pins.
- The **AccelStepper library** is great for handling stepper motor movements with smooth acceleration and deceleration. It supports both full-step and half-step modes, which is important for controlling the **28BYJ-48 stepper motors**.

**2. IO Card Connected via Network Cable to Stepper Motor Breakout Board:**

- The **IO Card** connects to the **Stepper Motor Breakout Board** via a network cable (likely using something like a CAT5 or CAT6 cable for signal routing), which is a good choice for distributing signals over a long distance.
- The **Stepper Motor Breakout Board** contains the **M54562FP**, which is responsible for switching the motor phases based on the signals from the MCP23017 GPIO.

**3. M54562FP Driving the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor:**

- The **M54562FP** is an 8-channel Darlington transistor array, which makes it ideal for controlling the **4 lines** needed for each stepper motor (since the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor uses 4 phases).
- The **M54562FP** is designed to handle the **12V supply** that powers the 28BYJ-48 stepper motors. It will sink the current through each of the motor's windings as needed to drive the motor in the correct sequence.

**4. Power Supply (LM7812) for 12V:**

- The **LM7812** linear voltage regulator provides a regulated **12V output**, which is necessary for the **M54562FP** to drive the **28BYJ-48 stepper motors**.
- Since the **28BYJ-48** is a **12V stepper motor**, the LM7812 ensures that both the motors and the **M54562FP** receive the correct voltage, allowing them to operate within their specifications.

**5. Supporting Multiple Stepper Motors:**

- The design allows the **IO Card** to support **2 Stepper Motor Breakout Boards**, with each Breakout Board controlling **2 stepper motors**.
- Since the **M54562FP** has **8 channels**, each motor will use **4 channels** to control its 4 phases. Therefore, each breakout board can support **2 stepper motors** using the 8 channels available on the M54562FP.
- The **JST XH 5-wire connector** on the breakout board makes it convenient to connect the **28BYJ-48 stepper motors** without complex wiring.

**Overall Design Workflow**:

1. **ESP32** sends commands via **I2C** to the **MCP23017**.
2. The **MCP23017** expands the GPIO pins and outputs the step sequence (using the **AccelStepper** library) to control the 4 lines of the stepper motors.
3. The **Stepper Motor Breakout Board**, containing the **M54562FP**, receives these signals and switches the appropriate motor phases by sinking the current through the motor windings.
4. The **LM7812** regulator supplies a stable **12V** to both the **M54562FP** and the **28BYJ-48 stepper motors**, allowing the motors to run reliably.

## Testing and Verification

### Visual Inspection

1. **Initial Check**: Examine the board for any obvious issues like missing components, solder bridges, or components that are misaligned or not fully seated.
2. **Solder Joint Inspection**: Use a magnifying glass or a microscope to inspect solder joints. Look for cold solder joints, insufficient or excessive solder, or any shorts between pads.
